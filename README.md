# Description
Hello! This is my next project on Python. It allows you to make a spam attack on one email. 
You can add your mail (so far only mail.ru) to the file data.json in the format specified in the file itself.
To use the program, you need to create a "separate password" for mail. This is described in this article - https://help.mail.ru/mail/security/protection/external.
Enjoyable use!

## Installation Guide:
1) Download Python from official site
2) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required modules
3) Fill in data.json, you can add as many as you want e-mails
4) Start main.py
